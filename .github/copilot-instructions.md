# Global Agent Guidelines

## Commit Messages

Always use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when creating commits.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.) |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| `build` | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| `ci` | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts |
| `chore` | Other changes that don't modify source or test files |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

### Examples

```
feat: add string tension tracking
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
docs: update README with setup instructions
chore: bump dependencies
```

### Breaking Changes

Append `!` after the type/scope for breaking changes, and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
feat!: redesign racket API

BREAKING CHANGE: racket endpoint now requires authentication
```

## Pull Request Titles

Always use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for PR titles, following the same rules as commit messages above.

### Examples

```
feat: add stringing history export
fix(ui): correct button alignment on mobile
chore: update Docker base image
```
